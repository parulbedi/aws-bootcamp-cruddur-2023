Before jumping into the bootcamp there are few services where I have to create account, out of those there were few services where I already have account and for another I need to register:

•	Github Account – Already created

•	Gitpod Account - and also install its extension (I am using Microsoft Edge and it is compatible with the browser)

•	AWS account – Already created

•	Lucid Chart Account – Similar to draw.io but here you can share your diagrams with url to anyone.

# Week 0 — Billing, Architecture, Security
I learned about billing, security, and architecture of AWS with respect to security.

### 1. Few key points which I learned and were very crucial while working with AWS or any other cloud provider:
•	Pricing of services or resources vary and dependent of region to region

•	Setting billing alarm so that we remain under our desired budget and don’t get huge bills.

•	Attaching Administrator Access & billing policy to IAM user

•	I have my AWS free tier active and resources needed for this bootcamp is accessible to me.

•	Learned about TOGAF and C4 Model and few others, those all are created to tackle one problem i.e “How to break a complex Architecture in to a simpler task”


### 2. High Level Logical Diagram:

logical design of cruddur web-app. worked aorund with this tool for a day and understand most of its options.

### 3. Napkin Design (Draft design):

just a basic design (On a Napkin) 😜. Will draw a daigram in lucid charts soon.

### 4. Got stuck when i was not able to see billing details from IAM user account

I followed 2 steps to configure the settings and then billibg dashboard was accessible in IAM user account (thats me)

#### Step 1: Activate IAM Access

to acheive this i followed the following steps:
Login to the root account, Click on --> ###root --> ###Account
