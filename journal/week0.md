Before jumping into the bootcamp there are few services where I have to create account, out of those there were few services where I already have account and for another I need to register:

•	Github Account – Already created

•	Gitpod Account - and also install its extension (I am using Microsoft Edge and it is compatible with the browser)

•	AWS account – Already created

•	Lucid Chart Account – Similar to draw.io but here you can share your diagrams with url to anyone.

# Week 0 — Billing, Architecture, Security
I learned about billing, security, and architecture of AWS with respect to security.

### Few key points which I learned and were very crucial while working with AWS or any other cloud provider:
•	Pricing of services or resources vary and dependent of region to region

•	Setting billing alarm so that we remain under our desired budget and don’t get huge bills.
